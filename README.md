The ultimate military grade random number generator.

## ‚ùì What is this

This is main server portion of True-Random this handles incoming connections and API calls and then transmits them to
the dice rolling nodes. This is also what contains the main page for the site along with styling and other resources for
it.

image with this server running on it.
